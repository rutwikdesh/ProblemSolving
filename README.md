# Problem Solving & Fullstack Practice

Welcome to my code repository! This space is dedicated to my journey in practising Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and building Fullstack applications.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1. LeetCode & DSA

A collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems and other algorithmic challenges.

- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Focus:** Optimization, Clean Code, and Complexity Analysis

### 2. Fullstack Projects

_(Coming Soon)_
Here I will document and store my practice applications, ranging from simple utilities to complex web apps.

## 🚀 Goals

- Consistent problem solving to sharpen algorithmic thinking.
- Building scalable and modern web applications.
- Documenting learning progress and code patterns.
