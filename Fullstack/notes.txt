LRU cache

Design a notification service.

While solving the problem, for idempotency handling, I have used even-driven architecture.
The solution that I gave is publishing the messages in Kafka, and processing the messages through Flink. So that unique message gets processed exactly once, with respect to the idempotent id.

Interviewer's (Staff Software Engineer) comments

There is no way to handle idempotency using even driven architecture.
He was expecting solution with Redis. (Synchronous write-through caching)
I did some research, my solution is working and much-more scalable in case of burst traffic and bust notification.

a. You're the owner of an apartment which has 2 lifts. Tenants have been complaining about the inefficiency of lifts and how they have to wait so long for the lift. How will you go about this situation.

Question: Given a log file with rider information (name, city_visited, timestamp), make unique triplets of cities visited by the order of the timestamp and return the number of riders for each triplet that have visted those cities in the exact same order.

Follow-up:
a. if the information is too large for it to be stored in memory.
b. if you want to solve this faster.
